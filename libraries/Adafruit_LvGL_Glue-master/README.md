# Adafruit_LvGL_Glue
This Arduino library provides a layer between LittlevGL (a UI library for
embedded systems) and most of Adafruit's color TFT displays (anything that's
a subclass of SPITFT).

Examples show basic use on PyPortal, FeatherWing, CLUE and TFT Gizmo.
Use these as a starting point, see LittlevGL documentation at
docs.littlevgl.com for a thorough explanation of capabilities and use.
